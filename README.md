# Certified-Kubernetes-Administrator-CKA--Prep

This repository documents my preparation for the Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) exam. This space serves as a public portfolio and a personal knowledge base for my journey to mastery.

My goal is to pass the CKA exam by **January 2026**.

## ðŸš€ Learning Strategy

- **Theory**: The core curriculum is based on the official CKA domains. I am using the [Pluralsight CKA Prep Course](https://app.pluralsight.com/paths/certificate/certified-kubernetes-administrator) as primary resource. And Anki flashcards for spaced repetition.
- **Practice**: I will apply all theoretical knowledge through hands-on labs using my personal lab environment (e.g. Minikube or VMs on Oracle Cloud). 
  - [DoIt GKE Workshop](https://github.com/doitintl/gke-fundamentals-workshop)
  - Own ideas and scenarios.

## The main domains covered:

- Cluster Architecture, Installation & Configuration
- Workloads & Scheduling
- Services & Networking
- Storage
- Troubleshooting
